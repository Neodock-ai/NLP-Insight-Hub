# NLP Insight Hub

NLP Insight Hub is an AI-driven business intelligence assistant designed to extract actionable insights from unstructured text data using state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques and large language models (LLMs) such as Llama, DeepSeek, Falcon, and Mistral. The platform is built with a modular, scalable architecture and deployed on Streamlit, making it accessible and user-friendly for millions of users across various industries.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:** Upload text files or enter raw text data for analysis.
- **Pre-Processing:** Clean and normalize text data for optimal model performance.
- **Multi-Model Inference:** Leverage multiple LLMs for tasks like summarization, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Utilize custom prompt templates and dynamic optimization techniques to enhance LLM outputs.
- **Scalability:** Designed to support high throughput with caching and parallel processing.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Deployed on Streamlit for real-time, interactive data visualization and insights.
